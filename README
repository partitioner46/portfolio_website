# Hello!
This project is for my portfolio/personal website and is my first stab at web development (so go easy on my please). I don't have this up on a public server yet so be patience as I bang my head against a wall while I work on that in my free time. I won't sugar coat it, this probably is going to be an ugly website.

# Project Overview
I am using [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/) as the framework for this website. I am also leveraging [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for my front-end in order to speed up development.
